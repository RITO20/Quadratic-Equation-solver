# Quadratic-Equation-solver
python quadratic equation solver software 
This python program used python library: 
   1. Tkinter 
   2 .Pyinstaller (to convert .py to .exe)
 
While using the software enter the consonants of the variable with its sign in the entry beside it. 
To get the value click the calculate button.

This program will show answer of quadratic equation with:
                                                        D = 0| 
                                                        D < 0| 
                                                        D > 0| 
                                                     
if equation consists 2 values both the values will be shown in Separate entry box. if equation consists one value one entry box will say "only one value" and other entry box show the value.
